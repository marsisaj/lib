This is an as-yet-unnamed work which has until now been a barb in my brain, collecting fluff over several years.

To kick off, I've laid down my over-arching concern [here](shadows.md), i.e. what I want to research, and why.

Here's [feedback](feedback.md) I've already received, and notes I've made based on this feedback. Further comments most welcome.

I've made a started to list [readings](litreview.md) and [case studies](casestudies.md) to guide my further research & writing.

Dec-18: I've submitted a [paper proposal](robocop.md) to [this conference](https://law.unimelb.edu.au/digital-citizens/conference) in Melbourne, July 2019. That paper proposal covers some of what I want to explore here.

I'm intending to write for a general audience without sacrificing either technical accuracy or academic rigour.
