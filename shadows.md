# In Defence of Shadows

In Chapter 4 of his famous work _On Liberty_, John Stuart Mill outlines what is commonly referred to as the 'harm principle'. Mill argues that personal freedom must not be limited by law unless there is some harm to another person's interests. In other words, laws which restrict behaviour can only be justified if they only go as far as necessary to protect these interests. Any further, and the law is unjust. Mill wrote:

> As soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion. But there is no room for entertaining any such question when a person's conduct affects the interests of no persons besides himself, or needs not affect them unless they like ... In all such cases there should be perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the consequences.

He emphasised that harm to someone's interests does not include them merely being offended by something, or upset that something happened (unless it directly affected their interests).

Mill's view has had critical developments since its original publication in 1859. Although my thoughts are influenced by Mill's 'harm principle' and its critiques, I will begin instead with my own hunches about laws and liberty, without reference to other theories. I want to test these hunches against real-life examples and established work. As I go along, I hope to get suggestions of related issues and debates so I can follow them up.

For now, here's my general hypothesis.

When we make laws, we are shaping the social, economic and cultural possibilities for the future. It's a complex technology that can easily do more harm than good. Law gets up in people's business, and often displaces informal or traditional strategies, both personal and social. 

The law enters our collective conciousness with a plush cloak of moral authority, whether it deserves it or not. Almost without realising it, a new criminal offence which is initially rejected by a community can become first tacitly accepted and then taken to be a self-evident outrage (e.g. drinking alcohol in public). We write laws, but they also write us.

Law has a lag time which usually surpasses political cycles. The negative impacts of a law may not be felt for some years. At worst, the ill-effects could creep up on us like judicial pollution and we simply get accustomed to the bad smell.

## Bad law has bad consequences

For example 
- People hate cops
- Undermines good law
- Can actually harm people (e.g. drug law)
- Can block innovation
- Causes frustration
- Confuses people
- Makes people anxious
- Reinforces systems of oppression
- Hijacks people minds from thinking for themselves eg about risk

## Law was developed with imperfect enforcement technologies in mind. Also, there was more discretion

If you trace the history of many criminal laws, they developed in an environment where both imperfect enforcement and discretion was assumed. Drug laws are prime example of this, where a conviction for possession could substitute for a conviction for supply where it was difficult to prove intent to supply. A lesser offence, but something at least. The harm of possessing a controlled substance in and of itself is questionable. The real harm (if at all) is elsewhere. 

A wider legal net was a matter of convenience. It was understood that police and courts had discretion, and would use it. Police would only investigate and charge people with crimes in the public interest (take sex between two people both under the legal age of consent, for example, where technically both could be committing the offence of statutory rape against the other depending on the technical law in a particular state. This is not an area of crime actively pursued by police, and if an incident came to their attention, it is likely they would not press charges unless there had been some harm.) and the courts would make up for any overly harsh effects of the law by mediating their sentences. 

However both police and courts have a decreasing discretional scope these days. At the same time, there is increased surveillance, data collection and analysis. The tools of enforcement are increasingly sophisticated and accurate. If ever we need to ask "enforcement of what?" it is now.

Yes - the rapidly changing technological environment is making some law as we know it obsolete due the archaic framing that doesn't take into account new ways of living and working. It is also making the _way we make laws_ obsolete, due to the changed nature of what is possible in terms of law enforcement and surveillance. We can no longer be cavalier with our definitions of crimes, with the expectation that executive discretion or judicial discretion will smooth over its rough edges. If we want discretion, we _have_ to build it in, explitely. For example, utlitise subjective words like "reasonable" to create grey areas, breathing room.

Imagine a world where our criminal law codes were perfectly policed and enforced. That's the world we have to imagine, when we make our laws now.

## In defence of shadows

I grew up in a Bible-reading family, and there's an oft-quoted scripture about walking in the light.

> This is the message we... proclaim to you that "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all." If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. (1 John 1:5-6)

I was taught this entails you should only do things you wouldn't mind other people knowing about. If you wanted privacy, there was an assumption that what you were doing was shameful, something you wanted to hide because you knew that it was immoral.

My actual experiences with private experimentation challenged this assumption. I took some interest and consolation in the fact that Jesus seemed to be interested in secrets, too. Some miracle stories would end with Jesus asking people not to tell anyone about what they just saw. I liked the concept of Jesus keeping things on the down low. He needed the shadows. He knew there'd be trouble, he knew he'd be misunderstood, so he wanted to control when certain things 'went public'.

Jesus stories and what we can make of them aside, we have a similar 'walk in the light' refrain in our modern secular canon. 

> If you haven't done anything wrong, you haven't got anything to hide.

In response to this, we sometimes hear about systemic bias, imperfect evidence, incorrect predictions. Essentially the counter-argument that just because someone looks like they're doing something wrong, doesn't mean they are. What we hear less about is the problems with the laws themselves, i.e. where our definitions of 'wrongs' may be wrong. What do we have to hide? Our explorations, our experiments, that risk harm to no one but ourselves. Much of the law and the increasing technology that enables the law casts its high-beams too widely across the world.

Some people just want privacy. Others need it for their own safety - it's a question of life or death. Also, we need to cover those who organise and take action for civil society against bad laws and corrupt or unjust regimes. Let's not forget that the passage of German politics into Nazi-controlled regime conformed to the strict rule of law at every point. The law has no conscience but that which we light within it.

So we need to defend the shadows. They are a space we not only have a right to (from a libetarian perspective), but a space that we as a society, as individuals need. If we can't build shade into our laws, we will atrophy.
