C reviewed

_Feedback_
+ Should highlight more how important "closed doors" experimentation is, esp how many things were once illegal and are no longer so e.g. homosexuality, miscegentaion, weed in much of america etc
+ Agree that vanishing discretion is important, esp considering mandatory sentencing
+ Liked the point about implicit morality of law
+ Good to discuss topic of grey areas being essential
+ [Robocop](robocop.md) concept reminiscent of [Golem Genie](http://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-golem-genie-and-unfriendly-ai-part.html) thought experiment

_My notes_
+ Explore more crimes that are no longer crimes
+ Golem Genie good, also makes me think of the Veil of Ignorance, different context tho

+ Should consider concept of "intellectual privacy"
+ Recommended read: "Intellectual Privacy: Rethinking Civil Liberties in a Digital Age"
+ Search history reveals intimate development of thought; 'chilling effect' of surveillance

_My notes_
+ Consider targeted surveillance vs mass surveillance
+ Worthwhile to compare crimes such as murder vs arguably victim-less crimes
+ Interesting discussion re: child pornography crimes & fanfic - should search for essay I wrote on this

B considered first draft of shadows (pre-committing) from surveillance/privacy angle.

_Feedback_

+ Need actionable insights
+ All rights are restrictions in context of data / privacy, there are different cultural thoughts on this coming from different experiences (Silicon Valley vs EU)
+ Quantitative change can affect qualitative change. E g once a year, once a month, once a day, every second. Seems like it's just more but it's quite different. Changes _nature_ of the information, not merely the _amount_ of it
+ Laws not only compel corporations from handing over data, but to collect in first place
+ Corporate surveillance therefore becomes state surveillance, it's a blend

_My notes_

+ Could discuss subpoenas, the assumption that govts should have access to all available data for law enforcement purposes (also can discuss plaintiffs in civil law suits, I'm not as interested in that angle but has crossover) - are there good reasons to challenge this assumption now?
+ Need to directly comment on anti-terrorism rhetoric somewhere
+ Ressurrect abandoned research on how state of emergency laws used in Lanka?
+ Really like the concept of quantity of data effecting quality, write on this
+ Should explore different cultures around privacy e.g. Silicon Valley v EU GDPR (General data protection regulation)
+ Re culture - I recall conversation around 2000 w/ friend who thought he would like a world where at a glance you could see each other's complete history, political views etc. This disturbed me as dystopian. We are not far from this reality
+ Choose some examples of govt laws compelling collection and hand over of data, bust encryption (both for individuals and corporations). There are plenty
+ I'm curious - what happened to proposal in NZ of tort of privacy?
+ I'd been thinking of focusing on crimes and their enforcement, and state power, but civil/corporate issues bleed into what I want to talk about (e.g. who holds the data) so would need to broaden scope of thinking here
